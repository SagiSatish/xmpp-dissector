= Introduction =

This file is HOWTO for XMPP dissector developers. Before reading this doc you should be familiar with Wireshark README files, especialy README.developer and README.plugins.

= Files structure =

XMPP dissector is written as a plugin. Hence all files related to this dissector are stored in plugins/xmpp directory.

Files and their content:
  * packet-xmpp.c _(main file of the XMPP dissector)_
    * header fields (hf`_``*`) and subtree ids (ett`_``*`) initializations
    * XMPP_PORT
    * dissect_xmpp, proto_reg_handoff_xmpp, proto_register_xmpp - characteristic functions for each dissector
  * packet-xmpp.h
    * header fields (hf`_``*`) and subtree ids (ett`_``*`) exports
    * ETT_UNKNOWN_LEN - it describes depth of tree for unknown elements. If depth of tree for unknown element is higher than ETT_UNKNOWN_LEN then packet is set as malformed. In this case it should be increased.
