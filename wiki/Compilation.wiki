== Instruction for Linux ==

At first you need to download Wireshark sources. You can get it by:
{{{
svn co http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/wireshark/trunk wireshark-source
}}}

Next go to the sources directory and remove svn data:
{{{
cd wireshark-source
rm -rf `find . -type d -name .svn`
}}}

Now you have to get XMPP dissector sources (current directory: wireshark-source).
{{{
svn checkout http://xmpp-dissector.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ . --force
}}}

If you have all sources, you have to patch make files. It will allow you to compile XMPP dissector sources (current directory: wireshark-source).
{{{
patch -p0 -i wireshark_config.patch
}}}

Next you have to run
{{{
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/your-path/wireshark-bin
make && make install
}}}

If errors didn't occur, Wireshark is built correctly and you can use it by
{{{
/your-path/wireshark-bin/bin/wireshark
}}}
