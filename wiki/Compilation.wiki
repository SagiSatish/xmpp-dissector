== Instruction for Linux ==

At first you need to download Wireshark sources. You can get it by:
{{{
wget http://wiresharkdownloads.riverbed.com/wireshark/src/wireshark-1.6.0.tar.bz2
}}}

Next unpack downloaded file.
{{{
tar -xvjf wireshark-1.6.0.tar.bz2
}}}

Now you have to get XMPP dissector sources.
{{{
svn checkout http://xmpp-dissector.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ wireshark-1.6.0 --force
}}}

If you have all sources, you have to patch make files. It will allow you to compile XMPP dissector sources.
{{{
cd wireshark-1.6.0
patch -p0 -i wireshark_config.patch
}}}

Next you have to run
{{{
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/your-path/wireshark-bin
make && make install
}}}

If errors didn't occur, Wireshark is built correctly and you can use it by
{{{
/your-path/wireshark-bin/bin/wireshark
}}}
